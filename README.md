Web-Audio-Bluetooth

a custom protocol that utilizes a standard Bluetooth audio connection for wireless transmission of arbitrary data. Unlike dedicated Bluetooth communication profiles, this approach enables communication between commodity devices that support Bluetooth audio with ubiquitous peripherals and devices. We find that our protocol effectively enables robust arbitrary data transmission.
